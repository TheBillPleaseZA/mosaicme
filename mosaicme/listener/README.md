#Â MosaicMe Listener service

The MosaicMe Listener service is a Python application that connects to the Twitter Streaming API and listens for tweets containing one or many particular hashtags.

Once the application receives a tweet, it looks for an attached picture and obtains the URL. Then, it is going to send a message to the Engine service.

The application is going to discard tweets that belong to the same user that is configured to publish tweets and those tweets that do not contain an image.
